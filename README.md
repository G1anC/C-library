# EPITECH C PROJECT STARTERPACK

This is the template i used whenever a C project started at my school (EPITECH).

You can find :
  *  My entire library, from "piscine" exercices to functions built along the year.
  *  A customized Makefile with extra rules (cs (coding style rule) + commit (push files with writtable message))
  *  A clear and conscise base of a C project.
  *  Explanations of every library functions in "my.h" file
